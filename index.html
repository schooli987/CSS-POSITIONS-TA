    I woke up super late because I forgot to set my alarm (oops). Mom was NOT happy and kept rushing me to get ready. I had to eat my toast so fast that I almost choked! Then, just as I was about to leave, I realized I forgot to pack my homework. So I had to run back upstairs, grab it, and by the time I got to the bus stop, the bus had already left. UGH! Mom had to drive me to school, and she gave me ‚Äúthe look‚Äù the whole way there. You know, the "I‚Äôm disappointed in you" look..
    <p>When I got to class, I thought things would get better, but NOPE. First, we had a pop quiz in math, and I totally blanked on the questions. Like, why do they make numbers so confusing? And THEN, at recess, I was playing soccer, and the ball hit me right in the face! It didn‚Äôt hurt that much, but EVERYONE saw, and it was SO embarrassing. I tried to laugh it off, but I just know people are gonna talk about it for weeks.

      Lunch was okay, though. I traded my apple for some cookies, so that was a win. And guess what? Our science teacher brought in a real frog for us to look at! It was kinda gross but also really cool. I named it Mr. Slimy. My friend Jake said that was a terrible name, but I think Mr. Slimy suits him perfectly.</p>

    When I got home, I was SO ready to just relax and play video games, but of course, I had homework. And it was HISTORY homework. The worst kind. Why do we need to know what happened like a million years ago? It‚Äôs not like I‚Äôm gonna need to know about ancient civilizations when I‚Äôm older. But Mom said no video games until I finished it, so I had to suffer through it.

    Finally, I finished and got to play for a while. I was doing SO GOOD until my little brother came in and started messing with my controller. I told him to leave, but he just laughed and kept pressing buttons. And then‚Ä¶ I LOST. ALL. MY. PROGRESS. üò° I was so mad, but Mom said I needed to be "patient" with him. Ugh. Little brothers are the worst sometimes.

    Today was kinda fun but also a little annoying. In the morning, I woke up late because I stayed up reading my book under the blanket with a flashlight (Mom would be so mad if she knew üò¨). Breakfast was pancakes, which made me happy, but my little brother took the last one, and that was NOT FAIR.

    At school, we had a math test, and I think I did okay‚Ä¶ but there was this one question that made no sense. Like, why do we even need to find "x" all the time? Maybe "x" doesn‚Äôt wanna be found! üòÇ Anyway, recess was the best part because we played tag, and I totally won (even though Jake says he let me win, which is SO not true).

    After school, I watched some YouTube and played video games until Mom told me to do my homework. Ugh. Why do teachers give so much homework?? It's the weekend tomorrow‚ÄîFINALLY! I might go to my friend's house if Mom says yes.
